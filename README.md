# CRIME ANALYSIS

## Introduction
This project conducts a rigorous analysis of crime data spanning from 2020 to the present. With a focus on dataset cleaning and preparation, the exploration centers on performing insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset, accessible at [Crime Data from 2020 to Present](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present), provides a real-world context for identifying patterns and trends, offering a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing crime rates.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is rooted in the societal impact of understanding crime trends and contributing to public safety. Analyzing and interpreting crime data aims to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of criminal activities. Understanding temporal and spatial patterns, identifying prevalent crime types, and exploring correlations with economic factors can aid law enforcement and policymakers in making informed decisions to enhance public safety.

## Tech Stack/Framework Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Working
The dataset was meticulously inspected, ensuring data quality through thorough cleaning processes, including handling missing data, removing duplicates, and standardization for consistency. The exploratory phase unfolded with a visual exploration of crime trends from 2020 to the present, unveiling insights into seasonal patterns and temporal dynamics. Notable variations in crime rates between regions and cities were scrutinized, and correlations with economic factors were explored. The project delved deeper into the intricate relationship between the day of the week and the frequency of specific crime types. Additionally, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), a predictive modeling technique, was employed to forecast future crime trends.
