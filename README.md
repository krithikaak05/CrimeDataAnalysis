# CRIME ANALYSIS

:chart_with_upwards_trend: **Introduction:**

This project embarks on an extensive Crime Analysis, spanning data from 2020 to the present. Emphasizing meticulous dataset cleaning and preparation, the exploration is geared towards performing insightful Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The dataset, accessible at [Crime Data from 2020 to Present](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present), provides a real-world context to identify patterns and trends, offering a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing crime rates.

:rocket: **Motivation:**

The motivation behind this project is deeply rooted in the societal impact of understanding crime trends and contributing to public safety. Analyzing crime data seeks to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of criminal activities. Understanding temporal and spatial patterns, identifying prevalent crime types, and exploring correlations with economic factors can aid law enforcement and policymakers in making informed decisions to enhance public safety.

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

:hammer_and_wrench: **Working:**

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Meticulously inspected the dataset, ensuring data quality through thorough cleaning processes.
   - Handled missing data, removed duplicates, and standardized for consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted visual exploration of crime trends from 2020 to the present, unveiling insights into seasonal patterns and temporal dynamics.
   - Scrutinized notable variations in crime rates between regions and cities.

3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Explored correlations with economic factors to understand their impact on crime rates.

4. **Temporal and Spatial Patterns:**
   - Delved into the intricate relationship between the day of the week and the frequency of specific crime types.
   - Investigated the potential impact of major events or policy changes on crime rates.

5. **Predictive Modeling (ARIMA):**
   - Employed ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for forecasting future crime trends.
